# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles I've created for personal use. Please, use them, improve them, and share your improvements with me and the world.

## Behavior

Clone this repo to your home directory as `.dotfiles`.

- [`link/`](./link) contains files and directories that should be linked to your home directory.
- [`source/`](./source/) contains files that will be sourced at login.
- [`config/`](./config/) contains configuration files that will be referenced elsewhere.
- [`setup/install/`](./setup/install) contains installation lists for things like homebrew. It's
  mostly out of date.
